    <div id="text"> <img height="266px" width="200px" src ="assets/images/IMG_0112.JPG"/><p>Born in Venezuela, a country with severe social/political issues, ever since 
        I have use of my reasoning I noticed that the society I come from has faced many cultural crisis. Came to the U.S.A at the age of 12 years old, 
        my mother and I moved here in the search of better opportunities for our future. The state of Texas, more specifically in the city of Houston 
        is where I attended middleschool and highschool and it was there where I learned English, in middleschool I took a " web mastering"
        class and from that moment I became fascinated with the things I could do on the computer and then display it on the world-wide web.
        I participated in the making of the school website and I felt really proud of being able to be part of that. 


            <p>I'm a sports fanatic, basketball and surfing are my main two sports that I practice. Exploring other countries and knowing other 
            cultures are also my interest, I lived in England, Australia, and France. I started my professional career by studying sound 
            engineering, I didn't complete it then I switched to business administration, I received a certificate, then I co-founded a 
            company in Panama with my sister, we build and lease retail commercial shops, we build them out of shipping containers. 
            Now that I am a bit more financially stable I have decided to pursue one of my passions which is to become a fullstack web 
            developer, something that I became very entrained with since a young age. </p>
